My research aims to develop Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms that enable real-world autonomous agents to make complex decisions in uncertain environments. My PhD research focuses on utilizing unsupervised learning techniques to acquire complex policies, particularly in scenarios where rewards are sparse.

**Bio**: My PhD is supervised by [Thomas Richardson](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/tom-s-richardson) and [Sebastian East](https://sebastian-east.github.io) in the [Bristol Flight Lab](https://flight-lab.bristol.ac.uk). I am also a commercial flying instructor and hold a masters degree in [aerospace engineering](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/2024/aerospace/meng-aerospace-engineering/).
